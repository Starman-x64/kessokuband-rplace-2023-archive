# Chronicles of the Kessoku Krusade
[[home/timeline|timeline]]

## Key Terms (Unless Specified)
- [[Kessoku Band]] - BtR sub faction composed of Kessokucord and r/kessokuband members.
- Kessoker - a member of Kessokuband
- commander - anyone with the “@r/place Commander” role
- soldier - members of the Kessokucord battalion; i.e. Kessokers who are not commanders.
- events highlighted yellow - major r/place event which are not directly related to Kessokuband

## Time Format
- Times in UTC+0. This means that r/place began at 13:00 20/07/2023
- 24-hr format, delimited by colons (e.g., 6:31 am = 06:31, 7.30 pm = 19:30)
- Dates **within** files are written in `DD/MM/YYYY`, with the year only if necessary. If the name of the month is be used, the first three letters are used, with the order remaining day-month-year (e.g., 20 Jul 2023)

## File Name Format
- **File names** are times written `YYYY-MM-DD hh-mm n`, e.g. `2023-07-20 06-06`. `n` is only included when multiple things occur in the same minute, e.g. `2023-07-20 06-15 1` and `2023-07-20 06-15 2`.
### Image Files
- Image files of images in events should be in the format `event_title`.
	- `event` is the name of the event file the image is included in (`YYYY-MM-DD hh-mm n`)
	- `title` is an optional short description of the image, replacing spaces with hyphens.
		- If the image already has a name, then `title` should be this name wrapped in **single** quotes (`'`). E.g., `'bad_enlistment_poster_1'`
	- Examples:
		- `2023-07-20 03-49_diplomacy-is-dank`
		- `2023-07-20 05-37_'bad_enlistment_poster_1'`
- Screenshots should be PNG files.
- If an image is an original source, keep its file extension and rename it using single quotes as above.

## Content Formatting
- Names of people are *italicised* and link to their respective file in `users`. Italicising asterisks go ***outside*** the link. E.g., *[[Starman_x64]]* (`*[[Starman_x64]]*`).
- Names of factions are **emboldened** and link to their respective file in `factions`. Emboldening asterisks go **outside*** the link. E.g, **[[Kessoku Band]]** (`**[[Kessoku Band]]**`).
- Images/videos (including screenshots/screencaps) should always be paired with a link to their source beneath the image: ([Image Source](https://www.put_link_to_image_here)) `([Image Source](https://www.put_link_to_image_here))`
- Events are to end with a trailing newline/line break.  
## Link Format
- Links to users and factions are *short* WikiLinks. E.g., `[[Starman_x64]]`, `[[Kesoku Band]]`.
- All other links are *absolute* WikiLinks. E.g., `![[media/archive-banner.png]]`, `[[topFolder/nextFolder/target]]`.
